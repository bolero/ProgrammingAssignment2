## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", 
## which is really a list containing a function to

## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse of matrix
## get the value of the inverse of matrix

## The second function (cacheSolve) calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if 
## the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from 
## the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the 
## inverse of the data and sets the value of the inversem in the cache via 
## the setmean function.

## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m<-NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse  = getinverse)

}


## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already 
## been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve 
##should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x , ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
